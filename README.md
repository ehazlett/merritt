## Contributing

### Prerequisites

You must have the following:

- [docker](https://store.docker.com) (tested on 17.03.1-ce)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (tested with 1.11.2)


### Setup

To get started, clone the repo and run:

`./script/dev.sh`

That will take a while the first time this is run as it will download all the
dependencies and build the backend and frontend applications.

After that finishes, you should be able to visit 
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.
